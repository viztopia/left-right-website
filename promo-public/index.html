    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this time of intense divisions, a left partisan and a right partisan speaking with each other seems like an
        impossible conversation - or, at least, a conversation that is impossible to have meaningfully on certain
        so-called “hot-button” topics and complex realities, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or immigration.
    </p>
    <p>
        This devised, interactive online multimedia performance stages scenes that feature such conversations …
        performed by both human actors and bots. The human and machinic actors play different characters that embody,
        complicate, and deconstruct different types of performative, prescribed political identities on the left-right
        spectrum (approached with a US-focus but through a transnational lens). These political identities are shown to
        be not static or unalterable, rather, the result of relational, performative processes that occur over time and
        with technology. Theatrically playing with(in) these processes, Left and Right aims to call forth more capacious
        ways of being - and being political.
